# Cultural Inclusion & Embedding Aboriginal Perspectives Learning Module

An interactive learning module for Georges River Libraries staff, designed to build understanding and practical skills in embedding Aboriginal perspectives into daily library practice. This module is based on key learnings from the 2025 Koori Curriculum event.

## Features

- **Interactive Accordion Modules:** Five distinct modules covering core concepts from connecting to Country to allyship.
- **Progress Tracking:** A visual progress bar at the top of the page tracks how many modules the user has opened.
- **Reflection Questions:** Each module includes a modal with a reflection question to encourage critical thinking and practical application.
- **Knowledge Check Quiz:** A 5-question quiz at the end of the module to reinforce key learnings.
- **Curated Resource Links:** A collection of external links to key organizations and resources for deeper learning.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with a focus on simplicity, performance, and accessibility, using fundamental web technologies.

- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For modern, utility-first styling directly within the HTML.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity, including the accordion, modals, progress bar, and quiz logic. No external frameworks are required.
